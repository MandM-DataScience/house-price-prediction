# House Price Prediction

**Problem**: We want to build a regression model able to predict a "fair" offer price for real estate properties in Italy.

We structured the project as a Data Science showcase, in which we explain the various steps we took in a series of Jupyter notebooks, containing both the code and the thought process.

[Start here](notebooks/house_price_prediction.ipynb)

We recommend you explore the project using the notebooks provided, but you are also welcome to clone the project code and play with it on your own if you want to try different modeling techniques or use different data.

### What we did:
1. [Project foundation](notebooks/house_price_prediction.ipynb) (data collection, data clustering and get a baseline benchmark to evaluate model against)
2. [Data Cleaning](notebooks/data_cleaning.ipynb) (Explore and wrangle data with AWS Sagemaker)
3. [Modeling](notebooks/modeling.ipynb) (Try different models and compare their performance metrics with the benchmark)
